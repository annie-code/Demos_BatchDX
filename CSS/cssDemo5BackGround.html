        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to 
        be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style 
        Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

           HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and 
           other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. 
           HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics 
           for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
            HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. 
            Tags such as img and input directly introduce content into the page. Other tags 
            such as
    </p>
    <p>
        
        HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2]
